This voice assistant is a Python-based application that listens to the user's voice commands and responds accordingly. It uses the speech_recognition library to capture audio input and recognize speech, and the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert text responses into spoken audio. The assistant can perform tasks like telling the time, searching Google, and finding locations on a map, and is capable of engaging in a simple conversation with the user.
